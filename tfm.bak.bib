  abstract  = {Despite extensive preventive efforts, falls continue to be a major source of morbidity and mortality among elderly. Real-time detection of falls and their urgent communication to a telecare center may enable rapid medical assistance, thus increasing the sense of security of the elderly and reducing some of the negative consequences of falls. Many different approaches have been explored to automatically detect a fall using inertial sensors. Although previously published algorithms report high sensitivity (SE) and high specificity (SP), they have usually been tested on simulated falls performed by healthy volunteers. We recently collected acceleration data during a number of real-world falls among a patient population with a high-fall-risk as part of the SensAction-AAL European project. The aim of the present study is to benchmark the performance of thirteen published fall-detection algorithms when they are applied to the database of 29 real-world falls. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic comparison of fall detection algorithms tested on real-world falls. We found that the SP average of the thirteen algorithms, was (mean±std) 83.0±30.3 (maximum value = 98). The SE was considerably lower (SE = 57.0±27.3, maximum value = 82.8), much lower than the values obtained on simulated falls. The number of false alarms generated by the algorithms during 1-day monitoring of three representative fallers ranged from 3 to 85. The factors that affect the performance of the published algorithms, when they are applied to the real-world falls, are also discussed. These findings indicate the importance of testing fall-detection algorithms in real-life conditions in order to produce more effective automated alarm systems with higher acceptance. Further, the present results support the idea that a large, shared real-world fall database could, potentially, provide an enhanced understanding of the fall process and the information needed to design and evaluate a high-performance fall detector.},

  abstract = {Falls are a major cause of injuries and deaths in older adults. Even when no injury occurs, about half of all older adults who fall are unable to get up without assistance. The extended period of lying on the floor often leads to medical complications, including muscle damage, dehydration, anxiety and fear of falling. Wearable sensor systems incorporating accelerometers and/or gyroscopes are designed to prevent long lies by automatically detecting and alerting care providers to the occurrence of a fall. Research groups have reported up to 100 accuracy in detecting falls in experimental settings. However, there is a lack of studies examining accuracy in the real-world setting. In this study, we examined the accuracy of a fall detection system based on real-world fall and non-fall data sets. Five young adults and 19 older adults went about their daily activities while wearing tri-axial accelerometers. Older adults experienced 10 unanticipated falls during the data collection. Approximately 400 hours of activities of daily living were recorded. We employed a machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, to identify falls and non-fall events. We found that our system was able to detect 8 out of the 10 falls in older adults using signals from a single accelerometer (waist or sternum). Furthermore, our system did not report any false alarm during approximately 28.5 hours of recorded data from young adults. However, with older adults, the false positive rate among individuals ranged from 0 to 0.3 false alarms per hour. While our system showed higher fall detection and substantially lower false positive rate than the existing fall detection systems, there is a need for continuous efforts to collect real-world data within the target population to perform fall validation studies for fall detection systems on bigger real-world fall and non-fall datasets.},

  abstract = {A fall detection module is an important component of community-based care for the elderly to reduce their health risk. It requires the accuracy of detections as well as maintains energy saving. In order to meet the above requirements, a sensing module-integrated energy-efficient sensor was developed which can sense and cache the data of human activity in sleep mode, and an interrupt-driven algorithm is proposed to transmit the data to a server integrated with ZigBee. Secondly, a deep neural network for fall detection (FD-DNN) running on the server is carefully designed to detect falls accurately. FD-DNN, which combines the convolutional neural networks (CNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms, was tested on both with online and offline datasets. The experimental result shows that it takes advantage of CNN and LSTM, and achieved 99.17 fall detection accuracy, while its specificity and sensitivity are 99.94 and 94.09, respectively. Meanwhile, it has the characteristics of low power consumption.},

  abstract = {The automatic recognition of human falls is currently an important topic of research for the computer vision and artificial intelligence communities. In image analysis, it is common to use a vision-based approach for fall detection and classification systems due to the recent exponential increase in the use of cameras. Moreover, deep learning techniques have revolutionized vision-based approaches. These techniques are considered robust and reliable solutions for detection and classification problems, mostly using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Recently, our research group released a public multimodal dataset for fall detection called the UP-Fall Detection dataset, and studies on modality approaches for fall detection and classification are required. Focusing only on a vision-based approach, in this paper, we present a fall detection system based on a 2D CNN inference method and multiple cameras. This approach analyzes images in fixed time windows and extracts features using an optical flow method that obtains information on the relative motion between two consecutive images. We tested this approach on our public dataset, and the results showed that our proposed multi-vision-based approach detects human falls and achieves an accuracy of 95.64 compared to state-of-the-art methods with a simple CNN network architecture.},

In several Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems, these transitions cannot be disregarded due to their noticeable incidence with respect to the duration of other Basic Activities (BAs). In this work, we propose an online smartphone-based HAR system which deals with the occurrence of postural transitions. If treated properly, the system accuracy improves by avoiding fluctuations in the classifier. The method consists of concurrently exploiting Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and temporal filters of activity probability estimations within a limited time window. We present the benefits of this approach through experiments over a HAR dataset which has been updated with PTs and made publicly available. We also show the new approach performs better than a previous baseline system, where PTs were not taken into account.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we report our improvement on the prediction accuracy of pre-impact fall detection by applying a learning-based method on the real-time data from an IMU (inertial measurement unit)-sensor mounted on the waist, making it possible to achieve a high accuracy on a wearable device with the extracted features. Using the fixed threshold method is difficult for achieving satisfactory detection accuracy, due to various characteristics and behaviors in the movement of different individuals. In contrast, one could realize high-accuracy detection with machine learning-based methods, but it is difficult to apply them in the wearable devices due to the high hardware requirement. Our method merges the two methods above. We build a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a class activation mapping (CAM) method, which could highlight the class-specific region in the data and obtain a hot map of the fall data. After training on the MobiAct dataset, the model could achieve high-accuracy detection (95.55) and obtain the region with high contributions to the classification. Then, we manually extract effective features and characteristics of this region and form our special threshold method, achieving pre-impact fall detection in real-world data. Consequently, our method achieves accuracy of 95.33% and a detection time of within 400 ms.},

  abstract  = {Despite being a major public health problem, falls in the elderly cannot be detected efficiently yet. Many studies have used acceleration as the main input to discriminate between falls and activities of daily living (ADL). In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using smartphones for fall detection. The most promising results have been obtained by supervised Machine Learning algorithms. However, a drawback of these approaches is that they rely on falls simulated by young or mature people, which might not represent every possible fall situation and might be different from older people's falls. Thus, we propose to tackle the problem of fall detection by applying a kind of novelty detection methods which rely only on true ADL. In this way, a fall is any abnormal movement with respect to ADL. A system based on these methods could easily adapt itself to new situations since new ADL could be recorded continuously and the system could be re-trained on the fly. The goal of this work is to explore the use of such novelty detectors by selecting one of them and by comparing it with a state-of-the-art traditional supervised method under different conditions. The data sets we have collected were recorded with smartphones. Ten volunteers simulated eight type of falls, whereas ADL were recorded while they carried the phone in their real life. Even though we have not collected data from the elderly, the data sets were suitable to check the adaptability of novelty detectors. They have been made publicly available to improve the reproducibility of our results. We have studied several novelty detection methods, selecting the nearest neighbour-based technique (NN) as the most suitable. Then, we have compared NN with the Support Vector Machine (SVM). In most situations a generic SVM outperformed an adapted NN.},

  abstract = {With advances in medicine and healthcare systems, the average life expectancy of human beings has increased to more than 80 yrs. As a result, the demographic old-age dependency ratio (people aged 65 or above relative to those aged 15–64) is expected to increase, by 2060, from ∼28% to ∼50% in the European Union and from ∼33% to ∼45% in Asia (Ageing Report European Economy, 2015). Therefore, the percentage of people who need additional care is also expected to increase. For instance, per studies conducted by the National Program for Health Care of the Elderly (NPHCE), elderly population in India will increase to 12% of the national population by 2025 with 8%–10% requiring utmost care. Geriatric healthcare has gained a lot of prominence in recent years, with specific focus on fall detection systems (FDSs) because of their impact on public lives. According to a World Health Organization report, the frequency of falls increases with increase in age and frailty. Older people living in nursing homes fall more often than those living in the community and 40% of them experience recurrent falls (World Health Organization, 2007). Machine learning (ML) has found its application in geriatric healthcare systems, especially in FDSs. In this paper, we examine the requirements of a typical FDS. Then we present a survey of the recent work in the area of fall detection systems, with focus on the application of machine learning. We also analyze the challenges in FDS systems based on the literature survey.},

  abstract = {To solve the problem of vibration motor fault detection accuracy and inefficiency in smartphone components, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method based on the wavelet packet and improves long and short-term memory network. First, the voltage signal of the vibration motor is decomposed by a wavelet packet to reconstruct the signal. Secondly, the reconstructed signal is input into the improved three-layer LSTM network as a feature vector. The memory characteristics of the LSTM network are used to fully learn the time-series fault feature information in the unsteady state signal, and then, the model is used to diagnose the motor fault. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is verified through experiments and can be applied to engineering practice. Compared with the existing motor fault diagnosis method, the improved WP-LSTM diagnosis method has a better diagnosis effect and improves fault diagnosis.},
