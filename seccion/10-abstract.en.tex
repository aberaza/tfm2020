The need to continuously monitor elder people's health, and specially detect falls, one of the main death causes of this population, increases in an aging society. With this objective, many solutions exist nowadays, but they are either based in expensive propietary single purpose hardware, usually a wearable sensor and an external computer. These devices are expensive, highly obtrusive and restricted to the an area where the sensor can maintain a link with the main computer. This work will present a fall detection system based purely in a smartwatch, integrating in the same unit the capture, detection and alert components. This solution is presented to the user as an unobtrusive and friendly wristwatch.
