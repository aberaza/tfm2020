The need to continuously monitor elder people's health, and specially detect falls, one of the main death causes of this population, increases in an aging society. To solve this many solutions exist nowadays, but they are either based in expensive propietary one pourpose hardware which is highly obtrusive or in the capture of data through a wearable and a linked device that processes it making it less portable and not quite autonomous. This work will present a fall detection system based purely in a smartwatch, offering high precission detection in an unobtrusive and autonomous wristwatch.

{\bf Keywords:} Fall Detection, Human Activity Detection, RNN, LSTM, Outlier detection
