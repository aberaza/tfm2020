  abstract  = {Despite extensive preventive efforts, falls continue to be a major source of morbidity and mortality among elderly. Real-time detection of falls and their urgent communication to a telecare center may enable rapid medical assistance, thus increasing the sense of security of the elderly and reducing some of the negative consequences of falls. Many different approaches have been explored to automatically detect a fall using inertial sensors. Although previously published algorithms report high sensitivity (SE) and high specificity (SP), they have usually been tested on simulated falls performed by healthy volunteers. We recently collected acceleration data during a number of real-world falls among a patient population with a high-fall-risk as part of the SensAction-AAL European project. The aim of the present study is to benchmark the performance of thirteen published fall-detection algorithms when they are applied to the database of 29 real-world falls. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic comparison of fall detection algorithms tested on real-world falls. We found that the SP average of the thirteen algorithms, was (mean$\pm$std) 83.0$\pm$30.3 (maximum value = 98). The SE was considerably lower (SE = 57.0$\pm$27.3, maximum value = 82.8), much lower than the values obtained on simulated falls. The number of false alarms generated by the algorithms during 1-day monitoring of three representative fallers ranged from 3 to 85. The factors that affect the performance of the published algorithms, when they are applied to the real-world falls, are also discussed. These findings indicate the importance of testing fall-detection algorithms in real-life conditions in order to produce more effective automated alarm systems with higher acceptance. Further, the present results support the idea that a large, shared real-world fall database could, potentially, provide an enhanced understanding of the fall process and the information needed to design and evaluate a high-performance fall detector.},

  abstract  = {Falls are a major cause of injuries and deaths in older adults. Even when no injury occurs, about half of all older adults who fall are unable to get up without assistance. The extended period of lying on the floor often leads to medical complications, including muscle damage, dehydration, anxiety and fear of falling. Wearable sensor systems incorporating accelerometers and/or gyroscopes are designed to prevent long lies by automatically detecting and alerting care providers to the occurrence of a fall. Research groups have reported up to 100 accuracy in detecting falls in experimental settings. However, there is a lack of studies examining accuracy in the real-world setting. In this study, we examined the accuracy of a fall detection system based on real-world fall and non-fall data sets. Five young adults and 19 older adults went about their daily activities while wearing tri-axial accelerometers. Older adults experienced 10 unanticipated falls during the data collection. Approximately 400 hours of activities of daily living were recorded. We employed a machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, to identify falls and non-fall events. We found that our system was able to detect 8 out of the 10 falls in older adults using signals from a single accelerometer (waist or sternum). Furthermore, our system did not report any false alarm during approximately 28.5 hours of recorded data from young adults. However, with older adults, the false positive rate among individuals ranged from 0 to 0.3 false alarms per hour. While our system showed higher fall detection and substantially lower false positive rate than the existing fall detection systems, there is a need for continuous efforts to collect real-world data within the target population to perform fall validation studies for fall detection systems on bigger real-world fall and non-fall datasets.},

  abstract  = {A fall detection module is an important component of community-based care for the elderly to reduce their health risk. It requires the accuracy of detections as well as maintains energy saving. In order to meet the above requirements, a sensing module-integrated energy-efficient sensor was developed which can sense and cache the data of human activity in sleep mode, and an interrupt-driven algorithm is proposed to transmit the data to a server integrated with ZigBee. Secondly, a deep neural network for fall detection (FD-DNN) running on the server is carefully designed to detect falls accurately. FD-DNN, which combines the convolutional neural networks (CNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms, was tested on both with online and offline datasets. The experimental result shows that it takes advantage of CNN and LSTM, and achieved 99.17 fall detection accuracy, while its specificity and sensitivity are 99.94 and 94.09, respectively. Meanwhile, it has the characteristics of low power consumption.},

  abstract  = {The automatic recognition of human falls is currently an important topic of research for the computer vision and artificial intelligence communities. In image analysis, it is common to use a vision-based approach for fall detection and classification systems due to the recent exponential increase in the use of cameras. Moreover, deep learning techniques have revolutionized vision-based approaches. These techniques are considered robust and reliable solutions for detection and classification problems, mostly using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Recently, our research group released a public multimodal dataset for fall detection called the UP-Fall Detection dataset, and studies on modality approaches for fall detection and classification are required. Focusing only on a vision-based approach, in this paper, we present a fall detection system based on a 2D CNN inference method and multiple cameras. This approach analyzes images in fixed time windows and extracts features using an optical flow method that obtains information on the relative motion between two consecutive images. We tested this approach on our public dataset, and the results showed that our proposed multi-vision-based approach detects human falls and achieves an accuracy of 95.64 compared to state-of-the-art methods with a simple CNN network architecture.},

In several Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems, these transitions cannot be disregarded due to their noticeable incidence with respect to the duration of other Basic Activities (BAs). In this work, we propose an online smartphone-based HAR system which deals with the occurrence of postural transitions. If treated properly, the system accuracy improves by avoiding fluctuations in the classifier. The method consists of concurrently exploiting Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and temporal filters of activity probability estimations within a limited time window. We present the benefits of this approach through experiments over a HAR dataset which has been updated with PTs and made publicly available. We also show the new approach performs better than a previous baseline system, where PTs were not taken into account.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we report our improvement on the prediction accuracy of pre-impact fall detection by applying a learning-based method on the real-time data from an IMU (inertial measurement unit)-sensor mounted on the waist, making it possible to achieve a high accuracy on a wearable device with the extracted features. Using the fixed threshold method is difficult for achieving satisfactory detection accuracy, due to various characteristics and behaviors in the movement of different individuals. In contrast, one could realize high-accuracy detection with machine learning-based methods, but it is difficult to apply them in the wearable devices due to the high hardware requirement. Our method merges the two methods above. We build a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a class activation mapping (CAM) method, which could highlight the class-specific region in the data and obtain a hot map of the fall data. After training on the MobiAct dataset, the model could achieve high-accuracy detection (95.55) and obtain the region with high contributions to the classification. Then, we manually extract effective features and characteristics of this region and form our special threshold method, achieving pre-impact fall detection in real-world data. Consequently, our method achieves accuracy of 95.33},

  abstract  = {Despite being a major public health problem, falls in the elderly cannot be detected efficiently yet. Many studies have used acceleration as the main input to discriminate between falls and activities of daily living (ADL). In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using smartphones for fall detection. The most promising results have been obtained by supervised Machine Learning algorithms. However, a drawback of these approaches is that they rely on falls simulated by young or mature people, which might not represent every possible fall situation and might be different from older people's falls. Thus, we propose to tackle the problem of fall detection by applying a kind of novelty detection methods which rely only on true ADL. In this way, a fall is any abnormal movement with respect to ADL. A system based on these methods could easily adapt itself to new situations since new ADL could be recorded continuously and the system could be re-trained on the fly. The goal of this work is to explore the use of such novelty detectors by selecting one of them and by comparing it with a state-of-the-art traditional supervised method under different conditions. The data sets we have collected were recorded with smartphones. Ten volunteers simulated eight type of falls, whereas ADL were recorded while they carried the phone in their real life. Even though we have not collected data from the elderly, the data sets were suitable to check the adaptability of novelty detectors. They have been made publicly available to improve the reproducibility of our results. We have studied several novelty detection methods, selecting the nearest neighbour-based technique (NN) as the most suitable. Then, we have compared NN with the Support Vector Machine (SVM). In most situations a generic SVM outperformed an adapted NN.},

  abstract  = {To solve the problem of vibration motor fault detection accuracy and inefficiency in smartphone components, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method based on the wavelet packet and improves long and short-term memory network. First, the voltage signal of the vibration motor is decomposed by a wavelet packet to reconstruct the signal. Secondly, the reconstructed signal is input into the improved three-layer LSTM network as a feature vector. The memory characteristics of the LSTM network are used to fully learn the time-series fault feature information in the unsteady state signal, and then, the model is used to diagnose the motor fault. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is verified through experiments and can be applied to engineering practice. Compared with the existing motor fault diagnosis method, the improved WP-LSTM diagnosis method has a better diagnosis effect and improves fault diagnosis.},

Data analysis was performed using MATLAB to determine the peak accelerations recorded during eight different types of falls. These included; forward falls, backward falls and lateral falls left and right, performed with legs straight and flexed. Falls detection algorithms were devised using thresholding techniques. Falls could be distinguished from ADL for a total data set from 480 movements. This was accomplished using a single threshold determined by the fall-event data-set, applied to the resultant-magnitude acceleration signal from a tri-axial accelerometer located at the trunk.},

This study evaluated a variety of existing and novel fall-detection algorithms for a waist-mounted accelerometer based system. In total, 21 algorithms of varying degrees of complexity were tested against a comprehensive data-set recorded from 10 young healthy volunteers performing 240 falls and 120 activities of daily living (ADL) and 10 elderly healthy volunteers performing 240 scripted ADL and 52.4 waking hours of continuous unscripted normal ADL. Results show that using an algorithm that employs thresholds in velocity, impact and posture (velocity+impact+posture) achieves 100% specificity and sensitivity with a false-positive rate of less than 1 false-positive (0.6 false-positives) per day of waking hours. This algorithm is the most suitable method of fall-detection, when tested using continuous unscripted activities performed by elderly healthy volunteers, which is the target environment for a fall-detection device.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Our study shows that all three of them suffer rapid memory decay. Then, to alleviate this effect, we introduce trainable scaling factors that act like an attention mechanism to adjust memory decay adaptively. The new design is called the extended LSTM (ELSTM). Finally, to design a system that is robust to previous erroneous predictions, we propose a dependent bidirectional recurrent neural network (DBRNN). Extensive experiments are conducted on different language tasks to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ELSTM and DBRNN solutions. The ELTSM has achieved up to 30% increase in the labeled attachment score (LAS) as compared to LSTM and GRU in the dependency parsing (DP) task. Our models also outperform other state-of-the-art models such as bi-attention and convolutional sequence to sequence (convseq2seq) by close to 10% in the LAS.

In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase.

In particular, modern software is developed with more sizes and functions, and assessing software reliability is a remarkably difficult task. The recently developed deep learning model, called deep neural network (NN) model, has suitable prediction performance. This deep learning model not only deepens the layer levels but can also adapt to capture the training characteristics. A comprehensive, in-depth study and feature excavation ultimately shows the model can have suitable prediction performance. This study utilizes a deep learning model based on the recurrent NN (RNN) encoder–decoder to predict the number of faults in software and assess software reliability.

  abstract = {Operational flood control systems depend on reliable and accurate forecasts with a suitable lead time to take necessary actions against flooding. This study proposed a Long Short-Term Memory based Encoder-Decoder (LSTM-ED) model for multi-step-ahead flood forecasting for the first time. The Shihmen Reservoir catchment in Taiwan constituted the case study. A total of 12,216 hourly hydrological data collected from 23 typhoon events were allocated into three datasets for model training, validation, and testing. The input sequence of the model contained hourly reservoir inflows and rainfall data (traced back to the previous 8 h) of ten gauge stations, and the output sequence stepped into 1- up to 6-hour-ahead reservoir inflow forecasts. A feed forward neural network-based Encoder-Decoder (FFNN-ED) model was established for comparison purposes. This study conducted model training a number of times with various initial weights to evaluate the accuracy, stability, and reliability of the constructed FFNN-ED and LSTM-ED models. The results demonstrated that both models, in general, could provide suitable multi-step ahead forecasts, and the proposed LSTM-ED model not only could effectively mimic the long-term dependence between rainfall and runoff sequences but also could make more reliable and accurate flood forecasts than the FFNN-ED model. Concerning the time delay between the time horizons of model inputs (rainfall) and model outputs (runoff), the impact assessment of this time-delay on model performance indicated that the LSTM-ED model achieved similar forecast performance when fed with antecedent rainfall either at a shorter horizon of 4 h in the past (T − 4) or at horizons longer than 7 h in the past (>T − 7). We conclude that the proposed LSTM-ED that translates and links the rainfall sequence with the runoff sequence can improve the reliability of flood forecasting and increase the interpretability of model internals.},

With the development of deep learning, new ideas have appeared to address HAR problems. Here, a deep network architecture using residual bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) cells is proposed. The advantages of the new network include that a bidirectional connection can concatenate the positive time direction (forward state) and the negative time direction (backward state). Second, residual connections between stacked cells act as highways for gradients, which can pass underlying information directly to the upper layer, effectively avoiding the gradient vanishing problem. Generally, the proposed network shows improvements on both the temporal (using bidirectional cells) and the spatial (residual connections stacked deeply) dimensions, aiming to enhance the recognition rate. When tested with the Opportunity data set and the public domain UCI data set, the accuracy was increased by 4.78% and 3.68%, respectively, compared with previously reported results. Finally, the confusion matrix of the public domain UCI data set was analyzed.},

It reduces the number of distinct network parameter values by quantization in order to save the storage for them. In this paper, we design network quantization schemes that minimize the performance loss due to quantization given a compression ratio constraint. We analyze the quantitative relation of quantization errors to the neural network loss function and identify that the Hessian-weighted distortion measure is locally the right objective function for the optimization of network quantization. As a result, Hessian-weighted k-means clustering is proposed for clustering network parameters to quantize. When optimal variable-length binary codes, e.g., Huffman codes, are employed for further compression, we derive that the network quantization problem can be related to the entropy-constrained scalar quantization (ECSQ) problem in information theory and consequently propose two solutions of ECSQ for network quantization, i.e., uniform quantization and an iterative solution similar to Lloyd's algorithm. Finally, using the simple uniform quantization followed by Huffman coding, we show from our experiments that the compression ratios of 51.25, 22.17 and 40.65 are achievable for LeNet, 32-layer ResNet and AlexNet, respectively.},

  abstract    = {Although deep neural networks are highly effective, their high computational and memory costs severely challenge their applications on portable devices. As a consequence, low-bit quantization, which converts a full-precision neural network into a low-bitwidth integer version, has been an active and promising research topic. Existing methods formulate the low-bit quantization of networks as an approximation or optimization problem. Approximation-based methods confront the gradient mismatch problem, while optimization-based methods are only suitable for quantizing weights and could introduce high computational cost in the training stage. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective of interpreting and implementing neural network quantization by formulating low-bit quantization as a differentiable non-linear function (termed quantization function). The proposed quantization function can be learned in a lossless and end-to-end manner and works for any weights and activations of neural networks in a simple and uniform way. Extensive experiments on image classification and object detection tasks show that our quantization networks outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract    = {Deep neural networks are the state-of-the-art methods for many real-world tasks, such as computer vision, natural language processing and speech recognition. For all its popularity, deep neural networks are also criticized for consuming a lot of memory and draining battery life of devices during training and inference. This makes it hard to deploy these models on mobile or embedded devices which have tight resource constraints. Quantization is recognized as one of the most effective approaches to satisfy the extreme memory requirements that deep neural network models demand. Instead of adopting 32-bit floating point format to represent weights, quantized representations store weights using more compact formats such as integers or even binary numbers. Despite a possible degradation in predictive performance, quantization provides a potential solution to greatly reduce the model size and the energy consumption. In this survey, we give a thorough review of different aspects of quantized neural networks. Current challenges and trends of quantized neural networks are also discussed.},

  abstract    = {Network pruning is widely used to compress Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The Soft Filter Pruning (SFP) method zeroizes the pruned filters during training while updating them in the next training epoch. Thus the trained information of the pruned filters is completely dropped. To utilize the trained pruned filters, we proposed a SofteR Filter Pruning (SRFP) method and its variant, Asymptotic SofteR Filter Pruning (ASRFP), simply decaying the pruned weights with a monotonic decreasing parameter. Our methods perform well across various networks, datasets and pruning rates, also transferable to weight pruning. On ILSVRC-2012, ASRFP prunes 40% of the parameters on ResNet-34 with 1.63% top-1 and 0.68% top-5 accuracy improvement. In theory, SRFP and ASRFP are an incremental regularization of the pruned filters. Besides, We note that SRFP and ASRFP pursue better results while slowing down the speed of convergence.},

  title       = {A Signal Propagation Perspective for Pruning Neural Networks at Initialization},
  abstract    = {Network pruning is a promising avenue for compressing deep neural networks. A typical approach to pruning starts by training a model and then removing redundant parameters while minimizing the impact on what is learned. Alternatively, a recent approach shows that pruning can be done at initialization prior to training, based on a saliency criterion called connection sensitivity. However, it remains unclear exactly why pruning an untrained, randomly initialized neural network is effective. In this work, by noting connection sensitivity as a form of gradient, we formally characterize initialization conditions to ensure reliable connection sensitivity measurements, which in turn yields effective pruning results. Moreover, we analyze the signal propagation properties of the resulting pruned networks and introduce a simple, data-free method to improve their trainability. Our modifications to the existing pruning at initialization method lead to improved results on all tested network models for image classification tasks. Furthermore, we empirically study the effect of supervision for pruning and demonstrate that our signal propagation perspective, combined with unsupervised pruning, can be useful in various scenarios where pruning is applied to non-standard arbitrarily-designed architectures.},

  title       = {The Generalization-Stability Tradeoff In Neural Network Pruning},
  abstract    = {Pruning neural network parameters is often viewed as a means to compress models, but pruning has also been motivated by the desire to prevent overfitting. This motivation is particularly relevant given the perhaps surprising observation that a wide variety of pruning approaches increase test accuracy despite sometimes massive reductions in parameter counts. To better understand this phenomenon, we analyze the behavior of pruning over the course of training, finding that pruning's benefit to generalization increases with pruning's instability (defined as the drop in test accuracy immediately following pruning). We demonstrate that this "generalization-stability tradeoff" is present across a wide variety of pruning settings and propose a mechanism for its cause: pruning regularizes similarly to noise injection. Supporting this, we find less pruning stability leads to more model flatness and the benefits of pruning do not depend on permanent parameter removal. These results explain the compatibility of pruning-based generalization improvements and the high generalization recently observed in overparameterized networks.},

  title       = {Deep Compression: Compressing Deep Neural Networks with Pruning, Trained Quantization and Huffman Coding},
  abstract    = {Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources. To address this limitation, we introduce "deep compression", a three stage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work together to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35x to 49x without affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by learning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to enforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two steps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the quantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9x to 13x; Quantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection from 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required by AlexNet by 35x, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method reduced the size of VGG-16 by 49x from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of accuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than off-chip DRAM memory. Our compression method also facilitates the use of complex neural networks in mobile applications where application size and download bandwidth are constrained. Benchmarked on CPU, GPU and mobile GPU, compressed network has 3x to 4x layerwise speedup and 3x to 7x better energy efficiency.},

  abstract    = {Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of tasks, with the best results obtained with large training sets and large models. In the past, GPUs enabled these breakthroughs because of their greater computational speed. In the future, faster computation at both training and test time is likely to be crucial for further progress and for consumer applications on low-power devices. As a result, there is much interest in research and development of dedicated hardware for Deep Learning (DL). Binary weights, i.e., weights which are constrained to only two possible values (e.g. -1 or 1), would bring great benefits to specialized DL hardware by replacing many multiply-accumulate operations by simple accumulations, as multipliers are the most space and power-hungry components of the digital implementation of neural networks. We introduce BinaryConnect, a method which consists in training a DNN with binary weights during the forward and backward propagations, while retaining precision of the stored weights in which gradients are accumulated. Like other dropout schemes, we show that BinaryConnect acts as regularizer and we obtain near state-of-the-art results with BinaryConnect on the permutation-invariant MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN.},

  abstract    = {Quantization reduces computation costs of neural networks but suffers from performance degeneration. Is this accuracy drop due to the reduced capacity, or inefficient training during the quantization procedure? After looking into the gradient propagation process of neural networks by viewing the weights and intermediate activations as random variables, we discover two critical rules for efficient training. Recent quantization approaches violates the two rules and results in degenerated convergence. To deal with this problem, we propose a simple yet effective technique, named scale-adjusted training (SAT), to comply with the discovered rules and facilitates efficient training. We also analyze the quantization error introduced in calculating the gradient in the popular parameterized clipping activation (PACT) technique. Through SAT together with gradient-calibrated PACT, quantized models obtain comparable or even better performance than their full-precision counterparts, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with consistent improvement over previous quantization methods on a wide spectrum of models including MobileNet-V1/V2 and PreResNet-50.},

Without proper regularization, autoencoder models are susceptible to the overfitting problem and the so-called posterior collapse phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce a quantization-based regularizer in the bottleneck stage of autoencoder models to learn meaningful latent representations. We combine both perspectives of Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAE) and classical denoising regularization methods of neural networks. We interpret quantizers as regularizers that constrain latent representations while fostering a similarity-preserving mapping at the encoder. Before quantization, we impose noise on the latent codes and use a Bayesian estimator to optimize the quantizer-based representation. The introduced bottleneck Bayesian estimator outputs the posterior mean of the centroids to the decoder, and thus, is performing soft quantization of the noisy latent codes. We show that our proposed regularization method results in improved latent representations for both supervised learning and clustering downstream tasks when compared to autoencoders using other bottleneck structures.},

Previous work has shown that such training with noise is equivalent to a form of regularization in which an extra term is added to the error function. However, the regularization term, which involves second derivatives of the error function, is not bounded below, and so can lead to difficulties if used directly in a learning algorithm based on error minimization. In this paper we show that for the purposes of network training, the regularization term can be reduced to a positive semi-definite form that involves only first derivatives of the network mapping. For a sum-of-squares error function, the regularization term belongs to the class of generalized Tikhonov regularizers. Direct minimization of the regularized error function provides a practical alternative to training with noise.},

Injecting noises to hidden units during training, e.g., dropout, is known as a successful regularizer, but it is still not clear enough why such training techniques work well in practice and how we can maximize their benefit in the presence of two conflicting objectives---optimizing to true data distribution and preventing overfitting by regularization. This paper addresses the above issues by 1) interpreting that the conventional training methods with regularization by noise injection optimize the lower bound of the true objective and 2) proposing a technique to achieve a tighter lower bound using multiple noise samples per training example in a stochastic gradient descent iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our idea in several computer vision applications.},
